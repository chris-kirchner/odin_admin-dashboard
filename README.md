# odin_admin-dashboard
The Odin Project - Admin Dashboard

This project focuses on a single page "dashboard" layout with CSS Grid. Since all of the lessons leading up to this project were CSS Grid focused, we were encouraged use CSS Grid for the majority of the work here. I decided to ONLY use CSS Grid for the entirety of the page, just to see if I could do it (and because I only used flexbox in the previous project I worked on (odin_sign-up-form)). In most cases it seems like a grid or flexbox could get the job done, but I think using a combination of both flexbox and grid is potentially very powerful.

The main section of the page will reorganize itself automatically based on the width of the client window. I also wanted to incorporate some interactivity with the mouse, so there's some hover and mousedown states to play around with.
